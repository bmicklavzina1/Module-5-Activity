# Module-5-Activity
Here we examine the results of an Amazon survey on the likelihood of coupon usage depending on a host of factors. 
The first part of the activity is dedicated to the prompt. I concluded at the start that it would be easiest to 
drop the car column entirely, and to remove any remaining rows with null values (amounted to 4.7% of data).
On the whole, 56.9% of coupons were accepted. Plots were generated as requested for both the coupon type count and
the temperature histogram. Following this, the prompt asks for a more in depth data analysis of data for drivers
who accepted Bar coupons. In summary, the key finding here was that acceptance of the coupon was highly correlated
with the frequency of bar visits, with additional positive correlations with having non-child passengers and a higher income.
The second section is dedicated to analyzing gender disparities in coupon acceptance for coffee shops. At a rough
glance, there doesn't appear to be a correlation between gender and coffee coupon usage, but when the data is
broken down further by age we find that women under 25 (especially with higher income) are more likely than their
male counterparts at the same age to accept coupons. In addition, a pattern of gender consumption is found with 
time. Young women are more likely to accept coupons in morning or noon hours, while young men are more likely
to accept late night coupons. This information could be valuable to Amazon in determining what customers to target
and at what time.
